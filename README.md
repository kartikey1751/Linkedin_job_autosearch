# Linkedin_job_autosearch

This project mainly Contains web scrapping using Python library BeuatifulSoup, pandas, Numpy , etc.
My task was to scrape the entire job page in Linkedin, by jumping through pages. Then filtering out all the jobs on various parameters of your choice like location, job type, posted on date, etc. Then write out all the parameters for every such job into a .csv file, and to add new entries only every time I run the program.

* More than 10,000 job data collected in seconds
* Filters were customizable
* Tackled repeatation and duplication.
